React.ComponentPropsWithRef is a TypeScript utility type provided by React to extract the props of a component or a DOM element, including its associated ref prop.
Here's a breakdown:
Purpose: It helps in strongly typing components, especially when dealing with ref forwarding. When you forward a ref from a parent component to a child component (often a DOM element), you need to ensure the types correctly reflect the presence of that ref prop.
Usage:
With a DOM element: You can pass a string representing a standard HTML element (e.g., 'div', 'input', 'button') to get its corresponding props, including the ref for that element type.
TypeScript

    type InputProps = React.ComponentPropsWithRef<'input'>;
    // InputProps will include all standard <input> element props, plus 'ref'
With a React component: You can pass the type of a React component to ComponentPropsWithRef to get its props, assuming that component correctly handles and potentially forwards refs.
TypeScript

    interface MyComponentProps {
      value: string;
    }
    const MyComponent = React.forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, MyComponentProps>((props, ref) => (
      <input ref={ref} value={props.value} />
    ));

    type MyComponentWithRefProps = React.ComponentPropsWithRef<typeof MyComponent>;
    // MyComponentWithRefProps will include 'value' and the appropriate 'ref' type for HTMLInputElement
Key Distinction (especially for older React versions): While React.ComponentProps is a more general type for extracting props, React.ComponentPropsWithRef specifically ensures the ref prop is included in the resulting type. In React 19+, ComponentProps is an alias for ComponentPropsWithRef, simplifying usage, but understanding the distinction is important for working with older versions or for clarity.
In essence, React.ComponentPropsWithRef is a powerful tool for maintaining type safety in React applications when working with refs and component props, particularly in scenarios involving ref forwarding.
