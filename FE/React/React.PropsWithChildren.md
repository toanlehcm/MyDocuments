React.PropsWithChildren is a utility type provided by React, specifically designed for use with TypeScript, to simplify the typing of components that receive children as a prop.
Purpose:
When defining a React component in TypeScript that is expected to render child elements, you would typically need to explicitly declare the children prop within your component's prop interface. React.PropsWithChildren streamlines this by automatically including the children prop (typed as React.ReactNode) into your component's prop type.
Usage:
Instead of manually defining children: React.ReactNode in your interface, you can extend PropsWithChildren and pass your custom props as a generic argument.
Example:
TypeScript

import React from 'react';

// Without PropsWithChildren
interface MyComponentPropsWithoutChildren {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode; // Manually defined
}

const MyComponentWithoutChildren: React.FC<MyComponentPropsWithoutChildren> = ({ title, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

// With PropsWithChildren
interface MyComponentPropsWithChildren {
  title: string;
}

const MyComponentWithChildren: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren<MyComponentPropsWithChildren>> = ({ title, children }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
};

// If a component only takes children and no other props
const OnlyChildrenComponent: React.FC<React.PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};
Benefits:
Reduced Boilerplate: Eliminates the need to manually declare the children prop in every component interface that uses it.
Improved Readability: Makes your prop interfaces cleaner and more focused on your custom props.
Type Safety: Ensures the children prop is correctly typed as React.ReactNode, providing type safety for the content passed to your component.
